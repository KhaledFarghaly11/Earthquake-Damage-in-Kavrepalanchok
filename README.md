# Earthquake-Damage-in-Kavrepalanchok 


## Dataset Description:
- In this project, I'll work with data from Open Data Nepal to build a model to predict building damage from the Nepal 2015 Earthquake. I'll work primarily with data from the Kavrepalanchok district.

## Objectives:

- I acquired proficiency in getting data by querying a SQL database.
- I learned how to build a logistic regression model for classification.
- I learned how to build a decision tree model for classification.
- I learned how to incorporate ethical considerations into my model building.
